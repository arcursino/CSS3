<p> Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black,
 and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the
 level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed 
 to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. <br>
 Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.
